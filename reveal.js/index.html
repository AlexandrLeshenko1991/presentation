              React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.It
              allows you to assemble a complex UI from small, isolated pieces of
              code called “components”.

              React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and
              you can use as little or as much React as you need.

              Initially, React was intended to create websites, but later the
              React Native platform appeared, which was already intended for
              mobile devices.

              and optimizes your app for production.To create a project, run in

            Introducing JSX
          </section>
          <section>
            <img src="./img/app-jsx.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <p>
              It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We
              recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look
              like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with
              the full power of JavaScript.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 20px;">
            <img src="./img/jsx-exp.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then
              use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:
            </p>
            <p>
              You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly
              braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or
              formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 26px;">
            <h4>JSX is an Expression Too</h4>
            <p>
              After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript
              function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
              <br />
              This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for
              loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return
              it from functions:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/jsx-fuction.png" alt="" />
          </section>

          <section style="font-size: 22px;">
            <h4>Specifying Attributes with JSX</h4>
            <p>
              You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/jsx-atr-1.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in
              an attribute:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/jsx-atr-2.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript
              expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for
              string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in
              the same attribute.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="font-size: 22px;">
            <h4>Specifying Children with JSX</h4>
            <p>
              If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />, like XML:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/jsx-child-1.png" alt="" />
            <p>JSX tags may contain children:</p>
            <img src="./img/jsx-child-2.png" alt="" />

            Components and Props

            <p>
              Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces,
              and think about each piece in isolation.
            </p>
          </section>

            <h3>
              Function and Class Components
            </h3>
            <p>
              The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript
              function:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/f-component.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <p>
              This function is a valid React component because it accepts a
              single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with
              data and returns a React element. We call such components
              “function components” because they are literally JavaScript
              functions.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 26px;">
            <h5>
              You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:
            </h5>
            <img src="./img/class-component.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <p>
              The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of
              view.
            </p>
            <p>
              Function and Class components both have some additional features
              that we will discuss in the next sections.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="font-size: 24px;">
            <h3>
              Rendering a Component
            </h3>
            <p>
              Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM
              tags:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/comp-element.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <p>
              However, elements can also represent user-defined components:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/comp-w-props.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 24px;">
            <p>
              When React sees an element representing a user-defined component,
              it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a
              single object. We call this object “props”. For example, this code
              renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/comp-w-props-render.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 24px;">
            <h3>Props are Read-Only</h3>
            <p>
              Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must
              never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/pure-f.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <p>
              Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to
              change their inputs, and always return the same result for the
              same inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
              React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:
              <b>
                All React components must act like pure functions with respect
                to their props.
              </b>
            </p>

          <section style="font-size: 26px;">
            <p>
              Consider the ticking clock example . In Rendering Elements, we
              have only learned one way to update the UI. We call
              ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/ex-clock.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <p>
              In this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component
              truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and
              update itself every second.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 26px;">
            <p>We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:</p>
            <img src="./img/clock-ex-2.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <p></p>
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 24px;">
            <p>
              However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the Clock
              sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an
              implementation detail of the Clock.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally we want to write this once and have the Clock update
              itself:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/clock-ex-3.png" alt="" width="100%" />

            <p>
              To implement this, we need to add “state” to the Clock component.
            </p>
            <p>
              State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled
              by the component.
            </p>

              Converting a Function to a Class
            </h3>
            You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five
            steps:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends
                React.Component.
              </li>
              <li>Add a single empty method to it called render().</li>
              <li>Move the body of the function into the render() method.</li>
              <li>Replace props with this.props in the render() body.</li>
              <li>Delete the remaining empty function declaration.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
              We will move the date from props to state in three steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Replace this.props.date with this.state.date in the render()
                method:
              </li>
              <img src="./img/add-st-1.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            </ol>

          <section style="font-size: 22px;">
            <p>
              2.Add a class constructor that assigns the initial this.state:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/add-st-2.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <span>Note how we pass props to the base constructor:</span>
            <img src="./img/add-st-3.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <span
              >Class components should always call the base constructor with
              props.</span
            >

          <section style="font-size: 24px;">

          <section style="font-size: 24px;">
            <p>
              We will later add the timer code back to the component itself. The
              result looks like this:
            </p>

              Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class

          <section>
            <p>
              In applications with many components, it’s very important to free
              up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the
              DOM for the first time. This is called “mounting” in React.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the
              Clock is removed. This is called “unmounting” in React.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              We can declare special methods on the component class to run some
              code when a component mounts and unmounts:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/lcm-1.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <p>
              These methods are called “lifecycle methods”.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 22px;">
            <p>
              The componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has
              been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/lcm-2.png" alt="" width="100%" />
            <p>
              Note how we save the timer ID right on this (this.timerID). <br />

              While this.props is set up by React itself and this.state has a
              special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the
              class manually if you need to store something that doesn’t
              participate in the data flow (like a timer ID). <br />

              We will tear down the timer in the componentWillUnmount()
              lifecycle method:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/lcm-3.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 20px;">
            <p>
              Finally, we will implement a method called tick() that the Clock
              component will run every second.
              <br />
              It will use this.setState() to schedule updates to the component
              local state:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/lcm-4.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          </section>
          <section style="font-size: 22px;">
            <p>
              Now the clock ticks every second. <br />
              Let’s quickly recap what’s going on and the order in which the
              methods are called:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                When <Clock /> is passed to ReactDOM.render(), React calls the
                constructor of the Clock component. Since Clock needs to display
                the current time, it initializes this.state with an object
                including the current time. We will later update this state.
              </li>
              <li>
                React then calls the Clock component’s render() method. This is
                how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React
                then updates the DOM to match the Clock’s render output.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the Clock output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the
                componentDidMount() lifecycle method. Inside it, the Clock
                component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the
                component’s tick() method once a second.
              </li>
              <li>
                Every second the browser calls the tick() method. Inside it, the
                Clock component schedules a UI update by calling setState() with
                an object containing the current time. Thanks to the setState()
                call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the render()
                method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time,
                this.state.date in the render() method will be different, and so
                the render output will include the updated time. React updates
                the DOM accordingly.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the Clock component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls
                the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method so the timer is
                stopped.
              </li>
            </ol>
